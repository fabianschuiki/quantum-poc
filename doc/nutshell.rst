Information Quantum in a Nutshell
---------------------------------

The Information Quantum project aims to increase the abstraction of information in modern computing systems. Like files introduce an abstraction of the underlying storage mechanism, information quanta introduce an abstraction of information organization. Modern operating systems like Mac OS, Linux and Windows generate their user experience through programs that open, edit and save files. Many different file formats represent the same type of information, e.g. *.jpg*, *.png*, *.gif* and *.tiff* files all contain an image. The user's image viewer must be able to read all these formats in order to show a picture. Thus a program developer spends a significant amount of time enabling his software to properly make sense of the different information formats, instead of focusing on his main task: developing the program's main functionality.

The system described in this document provides a new approach to how information is stored and edited. The task of organizing and interpreting information is moved into a separate layer of abstraction. Programs are no longer concerned with reading files and making sense of their contents, but rather modifying information of a certain format.
